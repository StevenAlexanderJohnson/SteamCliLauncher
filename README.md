# Steam CLI Launcher

Steam CLI Launcher allows you to launch games from the command line.

> Why did I create this?

Because I wanted to.
It's good practice using Rust.

SCL utlizes Steam's API in order to look up user's information, and spawns processes in order to launch games through Steam.
Launching the games through SCL is completely safe and has no chance of you being issued a VAC ban.
It uses the Steam.exe application to launch the game, which is the same as if you launched it yourself through the GUI.

## Who is this for?

It's for whoever wants to comile it and use it.

I figured it is most useful in a Linux environment or those who know what game they want to launch but don't want to look through their library.
